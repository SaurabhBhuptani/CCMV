        <h2>Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) - Comprehensive Overview</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div id="DSSS" class="image">

        <p>Direct-sequence spread spectrum in Wireless Networks is a technique that transmits a data signal over
            a range of frequencies, spreading it uniformly across the allocated spectrum. Direct-sequence spread
            spectrum is used to ensure that a particular frequency band (and its corresponding range of
            frequencies) is kept free from interference. This technique can be related to escaping the problem
            of co-channel interference (like two different wireless networks transmitting on the same frequency
            band) and cross-talk interference.</p>

        <h3>Communication and Transmission</h3>
        <p>Direct-sequence spread spectrum can also be used as an alternative approach to orthogonal frequency
            division multiplexing, where the baseband signal is encoded and transmitted across a quantity of
            fixed, predetermined channels. In this situation, each channel may carry different information, data
            signals, or time slots for different applications within the same network.</p>

        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) is a communication system that was developed in the 1980s. It
            divides the bandwidth of a radio channel into wide frequency bands and transmits these signals over
            separate frequencies. In this frequency-hopping process, each signal is assigned a different
            orthogonal sequence of frequencies.</p>

        <h3>Security Applications</h3>
        <p>All other radios in the range must gain each signal sequentially and then transmit it, which
            significantly reduces the risk of interference from outside sources or jamming. When security
            agencies need to be ready to communicate secretly, DSSS can be implemented so that their
            transmissions cannot be spied upon by other parties who are monitoring broadcasts on a shorter
            wavelength or through tapping devices.</p>

        <h3>Working Mechanism</h3>
        <p>In order for a direct-sequence spread spectrum to be used in wireless networks, it is necessary that
            each node of the network has a frequency synthesizer. This synthesizer is useful in determining the
            signals that are required to be transmitted and at which frequencies these signals need to be
            amplified in order to ensure that interference occurs.</p>

        <h3>Modulation Techniques</h3>
        <p>The spreading code can be transmitted in multiple ways like Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK),
            Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), or more complex modulation schemes like Quadrature Amplitude
            Modulation (QAM). Different modulation schemes are used to select the transmit power in order to
            achieve certain characteristics.</p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced signal security without additional hardware</li>
            <li>Mitigation of radio-to-radio communication jamming</li>
            <li>Each symbol is encrypted with a specific code</li>
            <li>Prevents eavesdropping and message confusion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Large acquisition time with serial search system</li>
            <li>Requires high-rate PN code generator</li>
            <li>Requires very high bandwidth</li>
            <li>Synchronization affected by variable transmitter-receiver distance</li>
        </ul>
