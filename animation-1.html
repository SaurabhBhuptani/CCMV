                <p>Quantization is a fundamental concept in signal processing and digital communication. It refers to
                    the process of converting a continuous range of values (such as an analog signal) into a discrete
                    set of values. This is typically done when converting analog signals into digital signals so that
                    they can be processed by digital systems like computers, phones, and other devices. Let's break it
                    down into its key concepts and why it's required.</p>

                <h3>Analog vs. Digital Signals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Analog Signals:</strong> These signals have a continuous range of values. For example, a
                        sound wave or a voltage signal can take any value within a certain range (e.g., 0 to 10 volts).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Signals:</strong> Digital signals, on the other hand, only take discrete values.
                        They are usually represented in binary (0s and 1s) but can also be represented in other discrete
                        values.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Quantization Process</h3>
                <p> Quantization is the process of mapping a continuous range of values (such as the amplitude of an
                    analog signal) to a set of discrete levels. This process has two main parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> The continuous analog signal is sampled at regular intervals,
                        producing discrete time signals. This converts the continuous time nature of the signal into a
                        sequence of samples.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantization:</strong> After sampling, each of the sampled values is mapped to the
                        nearest value in a set of discrete levels. The number of discrete levels is determined by the
                        bit-depth of the system (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, etc.).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Quantization is Required</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Digital Systems Can't Handle Continuous Data:</strong> Digital systems, such as
                        computers
                        or smartphones, operate on binary data, meaning they can only process finite, discrete numbers.
                        Analog signals, like audio or video, contain an infinite number of possible values, which
                        digital systems cannot directly process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage and Transmission Efficiency:</strong> Storing or transmitting analog signals
                        directly is inefficient because they require an infinite amount of space or bandwidth. By
                        quantizing the signal, we reduce the amount of data needed to represent it, making storage and
                        transmission more feasible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Signal Processing:</strong> Once a signal is quantized, it can be processed
                        using
                        various digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. These techniques allow for operations like
                        filtering, modulation, compression, and error correction, which are fundamental for modern
                        communication systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practical Implementation:</strong> In practical terms, it is impossible to work with the
                        infinite precision of analog signals. Quantization allows us to represent analog signals with a
                        limited precision that is still sufficient for most applications, such as audio, video, or
                        sensor data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Quantization Error</h3>

                <div id="quantization-error" class="image">
                    <img src="quantization-error.png" alt="image" width="459" height="416">
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is the difference between the actual value of the signal and its quantized value. The error
                        arises because we are approximating continuous values with discrete ones. The quality of the
                        quantization depends on the number of discrete levels used:</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Representation:</strong> Quantization allows continuous signals to be
                        represented in a form that is compatible with digital systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Noise Immunity:</strong> Digital signals are more resistant to noise and interference
                        compared to analog signals. Once the signal is quantized and converted to a digital form, it can
                        be transmitted with fewer errors, thanks to error detection and correction techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Digital signals require less storage space than their continuous
                        counterparts because of the reduced number of bits required to represent the signal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Information</strong> Quantization inherently introduces some loss of information
                        because the signal is approximated to the nearest discrete value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantization Noise:</strong> This noise can degrade the quality of the signal,
                        especially if the quantization level is too low (e.g., using 8-bit quantization for audio
                        results in noticeable noise).</li>
                </ul>
